For the last couple years, ever since I started nofap, I've had this approach of constantly battling my urges. The maximum streak I could reach was 15 days. It was only recently when I changed my whole mindset towards NoFap did I finally get a long streak with little friction from my end. 

The typical mindset that most nofappers, especially new members have is to somehow keep the fuck away from locking eyes with the PMO demon. 

Allow me to give you a different perspective on this.

Essentially, we suffer from PMO only because we are heavily attached to our body. The mind and the body is dictating our lives. Let me tell you something, human life is capable of experiencing far more than what porn induced sexual pleasure can offer.

You need to ask yourself this: On your deathbed, as you recollect your entire life, what percentage of your life do you want porn induced sexual pleasure to occupy?

If you're still with me, let's cut to the chase.

**You don't need to fight the PMO demon, nor can you fight it.**

The only true way out of this sexual compulsion is to transcend it.

Remember the toys you used to play with when you were little? Now they don't seem very fun do they, right? That's because you've out grown them. You've evolved pass that phase. It's the same thing with bodily compulsions, you get over them through transcendence.

And the secret to transcending your sexual addiction is to become more alive. By becoming more brighter beings. The key here is **ALIVENESS**. The more alive you are, the more easily you're able to transcend the compulsions of the body. 

More aliveness also means more awareness (they're closely related to each other). If the pitch of your awareness reaches a certain level, sexuality will seem like a small thing.

Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean you won't enjoy sexual pleasures, you'll actually be in a more favourable position. Instead of compulsively wanting to arouse yourself, you'll have the power to consciously exercise control over sexual pleasures. You'll finally start to feel like a man.

## Okay buddy, the philosophy seems cool and all but what exactly do you want me to do?

Find ways to become feel more alive and start actively doing them. It's that simple. 

The standard set of habits that are floated in this forum can be derived from this principle.
Eating healthy -> More alive
Exercise -> More alive
Practising Meditaion -> Frees up your mind and energy, thus you feel more alive.
Cold showers -> Feel fucking alive as hell

You get the idea. 
The thing is _you_ need to start including things in your daily life that make you feel more lively. This will be different for each person. It could include pursuing something that you've been putting on hold because you're too afraid. Or it could mean going out for a quick walk. Do what works for you, and do it daily. Fapping won't even be an issue after a while. And trust me, your inner self is waiting for you to pounce on this opportunity. 

Hope this helps fellow nofappers. Much love <3

The problem is that you are currently under the assumption (consciously or unconsciously) that you are the ego.
The ego is defined as the sum of all identifications that you have undertaken. PMO is a result of this identification. (identification to the body).
Ego is darkness. You (pure awareness) are light. 

-- MLK quote

You can't fight your ego. You can only overwhelm it through transcendence. And this is achieved by raising the intensity of your awareness.
Fun Fact: If you raise your awareness to it's highest pitch, you are basically declared enlightened.

Let's first get rid of the underlying negative associations related to PMO. The discussion here isn't whether PMO is good or not.
When your brain associates it to be negative, it will exaggerate it, and thus amplify it's effects.
And that's why feeling a sense of guilt after a relapse aggregates the problem.

So there's two major components to overcoming this high volume short-term dopamine cycle:
1. Removing triggers
2. Raising your pitch of awareness (which I like to term as aliveness)

Number 1 includes deleting your gigantic pr0n collection or just going cold turkey from the internet.
Number 2 can include basic things like playing sports, dancing, overcoming fears, all the way up to achieving self-realization.

There's some overlap of these components and the 12 step program which is usually used to treat addicts.
The way I see it, reaching god is the same as reaching peak aliveness.

The idea is to implement a combination of 1 and 2 to the best of your abilities and push yourself to actively pursue those things.
But remember to not push yourself too hard. Or you'll burn out quickly.

Depending on your will power, different people need to take different approaches.
Some may  bulldoze through and get a long nofap streak on their first try.
While somebody else may relapse multiple times before reaching a long streak.
You need to consciously spend time in evaluating your approach from time to time and see if your level of compulsion towards the body is reducing or not.
Also, see how consciously you behave when you're in the act of relapsing. If you're more aware each time, that means you're progressing.

Again, the goal is to reach a point where you're bodily compulsions shouldn't dictate your life.

PMO addiction is probably the most stingiest addiction to get over but this forum is a testament to the fact that it is achievable (If approached with the right mindset).
